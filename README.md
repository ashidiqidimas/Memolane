Memolane is a photo-oriented diary app that let you to **literally** walk through the memory lane using Augmented Reality.

Users can save their best moments to Memolane using its diary feature. But unlike other diary apps, Memolane let users to re-experience those moments using augmented reality by creating a museum-like AR experience that is filled by Users' memories that they input to Memolane's diary. 

Each diary entry contains a photo, title, and description. From those, Memolane will create museum display stands from the photo and museum information signs from the title and description. Users can add a new diary entry by simply clicking the "+" button on the left.

To use the AR feature, users can click the "See in AR" button on the navigation bar on the left. Then, users can put museum display stands anywhere by clicking the location that they want on the screen. Users can put multiple display stands as many as his/her diary entry. Users also can move around, just like they would on real museums.

I created Memolane using SwiftUI and RealityKit, which make easy to create awesome AR experience. In fact, the hardest part of the project was creating the 3D model for the museum display stands, which I spent a week to study Blender.
